Locali (pronounced “Locally”) is a web-based social network, that is focused
on users interacting with one another on geo-tagged posts. Users are able to
interact with one another through viewing posts (posted to the main feed or a
specific group), and commenting on, or ’liking’ posts. Posts are geo-tagged,
and all interactions have timestamps. Users can also create groups which
have admins. These groups are fully sovereign i.e. groups run themselves.
